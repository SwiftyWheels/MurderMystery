Your name is [insert name], and you're a [insert age] year old [insert profession]. You awake from what seems to be one of the best dreams you've ever had to the sound of your phone ringing on your nightstand. First, you thought it strange that someone might call you late at night. You rub your sleepy eyes as you look at your phone, slightly confused, which is now illuminating your room. Then, while groggy from suddenly waking up, you lean over to grab your ringing phone.
Your eyes have a hard time adjusting to the blinding light that is emanating from your phone. The number on the phone seems familiar, yet it isn't saved on your phone, so you're hesitant to pick it up. You lay there, just looking at the ringing phone in your hand, contemplating if this is a scam phone call or something important. Finally, the ringing stops after ringing for what seemed like an eternity, and you feel a sense of relief. You think, "If it's important, they'll call back," and go to place the phone back on the nightstand.
It rings again as you're just about to place the phone down. "Ugh!" you say out loud, as you were hoping that you could finally get back to that fantastic dream you woke up from. You answer the phone and bring it to your ear. "H-hello?" you say as you answer the phone, your voice slightly hoarse. â€œ[insert name]! You finally picked up! You need to come home as soon as possible!" exclaimed the voice on the other end.
Concerned and slightly afraid, you ask, "Who's this?". "It's Eve! Your sister! Please come home right now! Something happened to dad!". Now your heart is racing, as you can hear the terror in your sister's voice. "What? What happened to dad?!" you ask your terrified sister. Before you can get a response, you hear the phone hang up.
Now very confused and startled, you bounce up from your bed in a rush to get dressed. Next, you frantically search your room for your keys and wallet and eventually gather everything. Then, still disorientated, you rush out of your apartment and get into your car. Finally, you reverse out of the parking spot and hurry to your parents' house.
You pull up to your parents' house and park in the driveway. Then, you quickly get out of your car and rush to the front steps of your parents' home.
As you approach the front door, you see it is already slightly open. This worries you, as your parents are always cautious about locking their doors.
You reach for the door handle and slowly push it open, peeking into the main entryway as you do so. As the room entirely comes into view, you notice a pool of blood on the floor. Your knees buckle from the wave of fear that has overcome you.
"Hello!?" You scream out into the house, hoping for a response from your family. Unfortunately, you hear no response back from the seemingly empty home. You take a few steps into the house and shout, "Hello!!!".
"Upstairs! Hurry!!" You hear a voice coming from upstairs. You're not sure whose voice it could be, but it is a female voice. You quickly run up the stairs and reach the hallway just above them. You hear the front door slam shut as you reach the top of the stairs.
As you look back up from the newly shut door, you see a shadow figure at the end of the hallway. "Eve!? Is that you? You ask the shadowed figure. Yet, you receive no response.
You run over to the shadowed figure and, to your surprise, see your dad tied to a chair with a hood over his head. "Dad!!!" You scream as you're horrified by the scene in front of you. You go over to him and lift the hood off. "Dad.. no!" you muster as the tears flow from your eyes. You check to see if there's a pulse but cannot find one.
As you're mourning your dad, you hear a loud thump from your sister Eve's room. You call out to her yet hear no response. You start to get worried that whoever did this could still be in the house and look for the nearest object you can find.
While looking around the room, you see multiple objects you could pick up. You see a lamp on a nightstand, a shoe on the floor, and a knife covered in blood next to your dad. Which object do you pick up?
You decided not to grab any weapon... Not sure why you would do that!
You chose the knife! A good choice. It's small and compact and will definitely protect you from any harm!
You chose the lamp! It's a bit heavy, but it will inflict severe damage on anyone who gets hit!
You continue on your journey!
