## Intro
Your name is [insert name], and you're a [insert age] year old [insert profession]. You awake from
what seems to be one of the best dreams you've ever had to the sound of your phone ringing on your
nightstand. First, you thought it strange that someone might call you late at night. You rub your
sleepy eyes as you look at your phone, slightly confused, which is now illuminating your room. Then,
while groggy from suddenly waking up, you lean over to grab your ringing phone.

Your eyes have a hard time adjusting to the blinding light that is emanating from your phone. The
number on the phone seems familiar, yet it isn't saved on your phone, so you're hesitant to pick it
up. You lay there, just looking at the ringing phone in your hand, contemplating if this is a scam
phone call or something important. Finally, the ringing stops after ringing for what seemed like an
eternity, and you feel a sense of relief. You think, "If it's important, they'll call back," and go
to place the phone back on the nightstand.

It rings again as you're just about to place the phone down. "Ugh!" you say out loud, as you were
hoping that you could finally get back to that fantastic dream you woke up from. You answer the
phone and bring it to your ear. "H-hello?" you say as you answer the phone, your voice slightly
hoarse. â€œ[insert name]! You finally picked up! You need to come home as soon as possible!" exclaimed
the voice on the other end.

Concerned and slightly afraid, you ask, "Who's this?". "It's Eve! Your sister! Please come home
right now! Something happened to dad!". Now your heart is racing, as you can hear the terror in your
sister's voice. "What? What happened to dad?!" you ask your terrified sister. Before you can get a
response, you hear the phone hang up.

Now very confused and startled, you bounce up from your bed in a rush to get dressed. Next, you
frantically search your room for your keys and wallet and eventually gather everything. Then, still
disorientated, you rush out of your apartment and get into your car. Finally, you reverse out of the
parking spot and hurry to your parents' house.
